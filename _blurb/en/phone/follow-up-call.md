## Follow-up call

Thank you for your time.  
My aim, working in a startup is to understand the active learning landscape and how teachers like yourself are using active learning, and I’m hoping that this will give you an opportunity to understand how we’re trying to change the nature of education and if you would like to join us or not.

Note: This deliberately does not say “use our product” - we’re creating a movement.

Does that sound ok?  
_Yes_  
Ok, I would like to start with some short questions:

\* pain points we can address

- 1. Are you using active learning in your classes?
  - _Yes_
    - What type?
      - _Pre-class video/reading_
        - Did the students actually do that?
          - _Yes_: What motivated them to do that? Students not doing pre-class work is a pain point we address. It’s useful to know the cases where this is not a pp too.
          - _No / Not many_ \*
      - _Open-ended questions in class_ (This is different to our aims, so move on)
        - Optional: Do you find that effective?
    - Using software?
      - _Yes_ [sw]
        - What type?
        - Is that free?
          - _No_: How was it paid for? Own budget? Institution license?
      - _No_ [using]
        - Do you have a budget for teaching?
  - _No_
    - Why is that?
      - _Didn’t know about it_
      - _Too much work_ \*
    - Are you interested in using AL in the future?
      - _No_ [no]
      - _Yes and can_
        - In your __FIELD_NAME__ class you mean? [could]
        - Or generally in the future?
      - _Yes but can’t_ [unable]
        - Why not?
  - _What do you mean by AL? / Well I do X, is that what you mean?_
    - Define in terms of our strengths
      - In contrast to one-way information transfer, having real-time feedback of student understanding to optimise the learning
      - Having students engage and exchange information with each other in class so their learning soft skills
- 2. One principle for maximum social impact is that we want students, even those who cannot afford to attend a university, to access material freely. As a teacher, would you be willing to purchase software to support active learning?
  - _Yes_ [willPay: True]
    - What sort of yearly subscription price do you think would be reasonable?
    - _Yes but can’t_
      - See below
  - _No, I wouldn’t pay_ [willPay: False]
    - Why?
      - _Only use free things_
      - _Only use university-licensed software_
        - Who decides that license?
  - _No, I can’t pay_
    - If you could pay, do you think this would be worth including in a budget?
    - How do you pay for other software?
      - _Don’t use other software_
      - _University license_
        - Who decides that license?
      - _Someone else buys for me_
        - Who? Get a name?
- 3.a. Are you using any software related to teaching?
  - _Yes_
  - _No_
- 3.b. Are you using any other software not related to AL?
  - _Yes_ [otherSoftware: True]
  - _No_ [otherSoftware: False]

Ok, thank you. That’s all for the questions. Shall I briefly explain what we’re building and how we’re aiming to change education?

So in a nutshell, the problem we are addressing is that traditional lectures are known to be ineffective in terms of information transfer and demotivating for students, and while active learning is much better, until now it’s been lot of work for the teacher, so our dream is to revolutionise education by making active learning the norm rather than the exception: by making both learning and teaching more efficient.

Did you have a chance to look at the website?

- _Yes_
    - Ok, so you probably saw our AL page that outlines how we’re trying to realise these education goals using challenge based active learning.
- _No_
  - Ok, so it’s probably going to be easier if I give you a chance to look through that on your own time - if you click ‘active learning’ at the top, it gives an overview of our approach.
  - Are you at a computer now?
    - _Yes_
      - If you go to challengehub.app and click ‘active learning’ at the top, you can see how we’re trying to realise these goals. Go through the page with them.
    - _No_
      - Briefly outline key points of how we’re trying to realise these goals.

We’re working with selected pioneering teachers who share our vision, and we do still have some slots available, and so and as a __EXPERIENCE_LEVEL__ teacher teaching fundamental subjects like __FIELD_NAME__, we would be happy to have you on board, do you think this is something that you would like to try in your classes and are you interested in joining us?

- Yes
  - What class do you think this would be most useful for?
  - What aspect of CH do you find most interesting?
  - (We know their LinkedIn account)
    - We use LinkedIn to authenticate teachers, much like you might use Google or Facebook to log into another site. Since I looked up your LinkedIn already, I can go ahead and set up an account for you. Would you like me to do that?
      - _Yes_
        - Ok - is your __INSTITUTE_NAME__ email address the same address you use on LinkedIn?
          - _Yes_ (If _no_ - ask what it is and note it down)
            - Ok - Are you at a computer now?
              - _Yes_
                - Ok, so I’ll just set your account up. Set up an account.
                - Ok, so now if you go to dash.challengehub.app, you should be able to log in using your __INSTITUTE_NAME__ email address. Can you try that now?
              - _No_
                - Ok, I’ll send login instructions by email, then if you have any questions, feel free to contact me.
      - _No_
  - (We don’t know their LinkedIn account)
    - Do you have a LinkedIn or GitHub account?
      - _Yes_
          - Ok, so we use LinkedIn to authenticate teachers, much like you might use Google or Facebook to log into another site. For your account I’ll need to know the public address of your LinkedIn page/GitHub username. After this call I will send you 
      - _No_
          - Ok, so we use LinkedIn to authenticate teachers, much like you might use Google or Facebook to log into another site. I will send you information about how to log in. Thank you for your time and I’m looking forward to working with you.
- _No_
  - Ok, thank you for your time.
- _Maybe_
  - Ok, well take your time. If we run out of slots we will just waitlist people so take as much time as you need and if you have any questions you have my email address. Thank you for your time.
