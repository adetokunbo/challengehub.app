## Overview

- Be prepared to interrupt
- Telephone sales may be the most efficient and effective but a balanced approach across multiple channels is optimal.
- Short effective pitches that get to the point and allow contact of many prospects within a given time are optimal.
- Assume they're going to say yes.
- Use their name

## Opening pitch

Hello, is that __Professor Smith__?  
_Yes_

Hello, my name is __James Cannon__ and I'm with a small _active learning startup_ called ChallengeHub.  
I’m calling you because we work with pioneering teachers who want to teach more efficiently and effectively than the lecture, and as __a faculty member at the University of Surrey, teaching physics__, I would be interested to learn if you already use active learning in your classes and how ChallengeHub might be useful to you.  
Are you free to chat now or would you be available to chat at __10am on Wednesday__?

Hello, my name is __James Cannon__ and I'm with a small _active learning startup_ called ChallengeHub.  
I’m calling you because we work with teachers who are fed up with lectures and want to pioneer more efficient teaching that is also more effective and fun for students, and as __a faculty member at the University of Surrey, teaching physics__, I would be very interested to learn if you already use active learning in your classes and how ChallengeHub might be useful to you.  
Are you free to chat now or would you be available to chat at __10am on Wednesday__?

### Yes, I would be available.

Ok that’s great.  
What I will do now is send you an email with a link to our website so you can understand more about our approach to teaching. Is s.smith@surrey.ac.uk the best email to contact you on?  
_Yes_  
Ok, then I look forward to speaking with you on __Wednesday__. Have a great day.

### No, sorry I'm busy

Yes, that's actually why I called.  
I would like to find a time that is most convenient for you.  
Would __10am on Thursday__ be better for you?

### Sorry I’m not interested

Ok, that’s fine.  
I do my best to only call those who are likely to be interested and clearly on this occasion I was wrong. Please accept my apologies for that.  
In order to only contact those who are likely to be interested, I wonder if you could give me a name of someone in your department who you think might be interested in active learning?  
_I think Prof. Tanaka is doing something with active learning_
Ok, that sounds great - do you have a telephone number?/Full name?/Email address?

### I don’t teach

Ok, then ChallengeHub is probably not useful to you.  
Nevertheless, I would be interested to learn more about education at __the University of Surrey__. Would that short chat on __Wednesday__ be ok for you?

### Are you going to charge money? How much does it cost?

_Aim here is to get them focussed on the aim more than the price_

As an early-stage start-up, we have not decided on the price yet, but we have made a few decisions.

- We want this to be free for students and challenges eventually to be openly accessible, so even if you cannot attend university you can benefit from the challenges made.
- We need to therefore make a balance between what is reasonably affordable by teachers and what it takes to develop the platform further. I don’t know right now what that will be, but it will be reasonable - we want this to grow to have a positive effect on the world.

### Tell me more about CH How is ChallengeHub different?

So the main aim of ChallengeHub is to enable teachers to replace the lecture with active learning.  
The problem until now is that active learning, while great for students, has always been difficult for the teacher to implement, so the lecture has basically remained the basis for teaching.  
So the aim of ChallengeHub is to improve education through active learning while at the same time reducing the burden on the teacher.  
There are a couple of things that are unique about CH that work to achieve this.

On the student side, students work through a series of challenges, spending more time on challenges that they find difficult and less time on those they find easy. This gives them control over their learning and therefore increasing internal motivation. It’s also possible for them to immediately check the correctness of their answers, providing mini motivational “wins”. And when they come to class we make use of optimised peer instruction, whereby they are paired, soon automatically, with another student who can help them. So overall their learning is more efficient and effective and motivated.

Meanwhile on the teacher side, the teacher can easily monitor which challenges students find easy or hard, so knows what to prepare and what not to prepare for the class. So preparation is more efficient. And then the class time itself is mostly spent walking around, talking with students, understanding their problems and making targeted interventions, so there’s no lecture to prepare. And of course if there's something that the whole class has difficulty with or you just want to motivate the students about a topic, you can still perform a class-wide explanation or presentation. So it’s quite flexible in that sense.

This differs from traditional learning management systems which focus on supporting the lecture. What we’re saying is: don’t lecture. Class-wide explanations about a specific issue or motivating demonstration: yes. But let’s make sure it’s useful, and make sure students have control of their learning.

Maybe it’s going to be easiest if I send you a link to the website that explains about this. Can I do that now?

### But if I don't force them to work then they won't do anything

Out of interest, why do you think that students are not so motivated?

Well the method is flexible so our teachers have employed various approaches.

- Making it clear that completing all the challenges is the best way to prepare for the final exam, and that the final exam date cannot be moved, motivates students to keep up with weekly targets.
- Another teacher performed a mini test every two weeks, and again, those tests were related to the challenges.
- Another teacher still kept traditional homework but then simply replaced part of the lecture with in-class challenges.

So it really depends on what you feel is best for your students.  
One particular advantage is that, because of the targeted interventions, it’s actually possible to locate and talk to those students who are not progressing, and figure out if there’s anything in particular that’s stopping them. Maybe it’s simply that they’re not good at managing their time, but then if you want, you can give them individual targets and review their progress every week, from early on in the course, to help them.  
At the end of the day though, such students generally have problems with the traditional lecture format too, maybe sleeping in class and copying homework from their friends, and at least this gives the teacher an opportunity to make an early targeted intervention if they want to.

### Yes I already do active learning

That’s great!  
What type of active learning do you use?

_It is likely that they are still using lectures in some form._  
ChallengeHub aims to change the information transfer baseline from lectures to challenges.

### Can I use ChallengeHub for homework?

_This really depends on what the teacher wants from the “homework”._  
Most teachers we work with use it to replace the lecture part of the education.  
Having said that, ChallengeHub has features such as students being able to check their own answers, rate the difficulty of challenges, give feedback and so on, and if they sound like they would be useful for homework too, then you could of course use them for that.

### I just do a tutorial class where students work through problems. Can ChallengeHub be useful here?

_Generally, the teacher needs to come up with the exact way that they use CH for their situation. We can only give general advice, unless they go into a lot of detail._  
Can you tell me more about what happens in the class now?  
If you think the features of ChallengeHub such as students being able to check their own answers, rate the difficulty of challenges, give feedback and be seated for peer instruction sound like they would be useful for the class, then of course you could use it for that.  
How do you think it might be applied?

### Can you just send me some information?

Sure, I’d be happy to do that.  
What information in particular are you interested in?

###But making challenges sounds like more work

_If they’re concerned about this too much then they’re probably not going to bite. So adopt a Prize framing; don’t push._

Yes, making challenges takes time. Some teachers start with changing just a bit of the lecture each week to challenges, but if you feel it’s going to be too much work then I think this is probably not for you.

One thing we’re aiming to do with open education is to make challenges shareable so you don’t need to make your own, but this will take some time to develop still.
