Subject: Active learning meeting (MEETING_DAY MEETING_DATE at MEETING_TIME)

Dear PROSPECT_NAME,

Thank you for the brief chat on the telephone yesterday.
I'm looking forward to speaking with you again on MEETING_DAY the MEETING_DATE at MEETING_TIME, and will call you on the same number as I did yesterday.

As promised, I am forwarding our site for further information:

https://challengehub.app/en

I co-founded this start-up to realise the dream of making active learning mainstream - the rule rather than the exception.
We work with pioneering teachers who want to do better than the traditional lecture, and I think our approach is somewhat unique:

- No more "lectures"
- Focus on the challenge, not the reading
- Have students take ownership of their learning
- Increase teacher efficiency (lower barrier to better teaching)
- Pair students automatically in class for personalised peer instruction (coming soon)

I look forward to learning about how you use active learning, if at all, in your own classes, and the extent to which ChallengeHub may contribute.

I will also be available on Zoom (https://zoom.us/) at the link below, however unless I hear otherwise I will assume that you prefer the scheduled telephone call rather than video.

Thank you again for your time, and I look forward to speaking to you soon.

Best regards,

STAFF_NAME
