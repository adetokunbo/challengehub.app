Dear PROSPECT_NAME,

Thank you for the brief chat on the telephone today. I'm looking forward to speaking with you again on MEETING_DAY the MEETING_DATE at MEETING_TIME. I will call you on the same number (PROSPECT_TELEPHONE_NUMBER) as I did today.

As a professor at INSTITUTE_NAME in FIELD_NAME, I am very interested to learn more about your education experience and outlook, and how that relates to education in your department as a whole.

As I mentioned, we support teachers like yourself who want to teach more efficiently and effectively, and our ultimate aim is to revolutionise higher education by making it easy to replace the lecture with active learning.
You can learn more about our philosophy and approach at https://challengehub.app
If you have any questions I would be happy to answer them during our chat.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to speaking to you on MEETING_DAY.

Best regards,

James
