Thank you for your interest in ChallengeHub!
Your request for an invitation to use ChallengeHub has been accepted.

You are joining a select group of pioneering teachers who understand that we can teach better than lectures and make learning more effective and teaching more efficient.

Although students do not need to register, we require teachers to register so they can securely manage courses and view the progress of the students.

ChallengeHub does not store passwords, and instead uses LinkedIn or GitHub for teacher authentication. For this reason, please inform us either your LinkedIn ID or GitHub ID.

If you have any questions at any time, feel free to contact us by email or our social channels below.

We would like to schedule a call to learn more about your situation and how ChallengeHub might be best made useful to you. -- maybe (James) - The idea is to establish a personal relationship with our first users so they feel comfortable in asking for help and become part of the journey rather than a passenger.
