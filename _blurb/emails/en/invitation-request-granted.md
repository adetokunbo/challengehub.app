Thank you for your interest in ChallengeHub!
This is STAFF_NAME.
Your request for an invitation to use ChallengeHub has been accepted.

You are joining a select group of pioneering teachers who understand that we can do better than lectures, making learning more effective and teaching more efficient.

ChallengeHub uses other internet service's logins. This is simpler and provides better security. Currently, we support login via either LinkedIn or GitHub. To enable your login, we need some account details from you before you proceed. If you have not got an account with either service, you will need to sign up to one of them.

If you already have an account with LinkedIn, please confirm that you use this email address as your main email on LinkedIn, and send us the link to your public profile.

If you already have a GitHub account, please send us your Github username.

Additional details are available on our website at https://challengehub.app/en/documentation/getting-your-account-ready/

If you have any questions at any time, feel free to contact us by email or our social channels below.

I would also like to schedule a call to learn more about your situation and how ChallengeHub might best help you achieve your goals. Would you be available at 09:00 on Wednesday for a brief chat? If so, please let me know what number I can best contact you on.
