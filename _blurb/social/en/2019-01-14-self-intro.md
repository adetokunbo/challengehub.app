Hello! We are ChallengeHub, an EdTech start-up supporting STEM teachers who are looking to try something different; those who believe teaching can be done better than the traditional lecture, but find the burden of traditional active learning too high. ChallengeHub aims to revolutionise education by making learning more effective and teaching more efficient.

This is achieved in two ways. First, lectures are replaced by a series of challenges, supported in class through peer discussion and targeted teacher explanations. Second, our innovative interfaces for both students and teacher support more efficient learning and class preparation.

After development and trials at Kyushu University we are now opening access on a limited basis to pioneering teachers at any university.
