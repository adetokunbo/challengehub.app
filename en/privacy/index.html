we will establish a personal information protection policy,
construct a personal information protection management system,
and strive for its implementation.</p>

<p>The term “personal information” as used in this policy shall mean
any information that enables us to identify you,
directly or indirectly,
by reference to an identifier such as your name,
identification number,
location data,
online identifier
or one or more factors specific to you.</p>

<p>For the purposes of the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016
(the “GDPR”)
Djinn Mentor K.K. is the controller of personal information
and responsible for our website
<a href="https://challengehub.app">https://challengehub.app</a>
(the “Site”).</p>

<h3 id="acquisition-and-provision-of-personal-information">Acquisition and Provision of Personal Information</h3>

to send out emails
or to communicate smoothly with our users.

  <li>Our professional advisors such as auditors,
accountants and lawyers, etc.</li>
  <li>Companies that provide services to help us
with our business activities,
such as data storage, maintenance services,
database management, and payment processing</li>
  <li>Third parties to whom we may choose to sell,
transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets</li>
  <li>We may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them—if a change happens to our business
then the new owners may use your personal information
in the same way as set out in this Policy</li>
</ul>

<p>Where personal information relating to
European based individuals is shared
with a third party located in a non-EU country
that has not received an adequacy decision by the European Commission,
we rely on appropriate safeguards,
such as the European Commission-approved
Standard Contractual Clauses
and EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks,
to transfer the data.</p>

<p>We are an international company headquartered in Japan.
We also work or may work with third party service providers
in different countries
(for example, cloud providers, web hosting,
help-desk software providers, payment processors).
Therefore, your information may be transferred
outside of the European Economic Area (EEA)
and stored, or processed in other countries
(including Japan and the United States of America),
as part of our business operations.
By using our Site,
you consent to any transfer of your information to these locations.

to transfer the information.</p>
