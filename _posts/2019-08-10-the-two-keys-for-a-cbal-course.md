In a rapidly changing society, the world needs graduates who have the motivation and the ability to continuously learn new things and innovate to create new ideas. Unfortunately, traditional lecturing does not achieve this. This is primarily because motivation is external, driven by teacher commands rather than the internal motivation of a student’s desire for growth and development.

Typically, external motivation is achieved through imposing penalties upon students if they fail to carry out instructions perfectly. For example, homework must often be submitted by a certain time, and without any errors. The has the effect of focussing students’ minds on avoiding these penalties, and learning and personal development becomes a side effect. This, in turn, reduces motivation of the teacher. After all, why make an effort to teach students well when their only focus is to tick all the boxes and avoid penalties? This impacts teaching quality, leading to a cycle of lower motivation by both students and teachers.

CBAL is designed to break out of this cycle, and CH provides the platform to make this a reality.

There are two key steps.

1. Convert from external (teacher-driven) motivation to internal (student-driven) motivation.
2. Make the learning efficient (let students optimise their time).

### 1. Changing from external motivation to internal motivation

#### Traditional teaching example
Students must submit homework by a given date. If homework is not completed perfectly and on time, students are penalised.

#### The effect
The primary objective becomes to do just what is necessary to submit the homework. The primary driver is external motivation provided by the teacher. After graduation, when the teacher is no-longer there, students find it harder to be innovative. They lack the know-how about how to study without external deadlines, have difficulty motivating themselves to study new things and find it hard to manage their time appropriately.

#### The CBAL way
The thought process in a CBAL class is very different. New challenges are typically released each week, and it is made clear to the students that getting something wrong is fine. In fact, they should come to the class with questions. Also, not completing all the challenges for a given week is fine. As adults, students have control over their own learning.

The teacher instills student internal motivation in a number of ways. Firstly, it is made clear that students need specific knowledge to pass the final exam, and that this knowledge can be best gained by completing the given challenges. Secondly, the teacher stresses that challenges build upon each other, so the most efficient way of gaining the required knowledge is to complete all the challenges in sequence. Thirdly, some variation in progress is fine over the short-term, however the date of the final exam cannot be moved so students need to keep pace over the course to complete everything in time. Finally, students are reminded often of the usefulness of what they’re studying, both for their future study and career. This is not only in terms of the course content but also in terms of using CBAL to learn how to learn.

The motivation of students is now clearly associated medium-to-long term goals (passing the final exam and future personal growth rather than short-term avoidance of penalties). Students learn to take responsibility for their learning, manage time better and build internal motivation. Weaker students are encouraged by the positive learning environment as students around them are seen to be progressing with the challenges. On the teacher’s side, less energy is taken up by finding ways to motivate students externally.

### 2. Increasing motivation through efficient learning

No-one knows how to optimise a student’s time better than the student herself. The quickest way to reduce students’ internal motivation is to block progress by forcing them to study inefficiently.

#### Traditional teaching example
Making a student listen to a long sleep-inducing lecture about something they could understand more deeply and quickly by studying in their own time, or making the student study material about a subject that they already have mastery of.

#### Effect
Students feel that they do not have control over their study, the subject is perceived as being less interesting than it really is and student internal motivation drops.

#### The CBAL way
Students spend more time on challenges they find hard and less on those they find easy. Thus their time is always optimised towards what they feel they need to study in more detail. For the challenges that a student finds easiest, they may not even need to refer to the suggested resources at all.

Furthermore, the timing of study is also put in the student’s control. With automatic instant feedback about correctness, students always have control of when they study. Late at night or early morning. Spending more time this week or next. If they’re behind, they don’t need to give up; they can catch up because they have not “missed” anything. It’s all in the challenges.

Finally, in the classroom students are deliberately paired with a suitable partner, enabling personalised instruction through peer instruction about topics they need most help with.

Thus, unless the student has finished all the challenges for that week, the student is never blocked from engaging with the course, and the student learns efficiently with high motivation.
