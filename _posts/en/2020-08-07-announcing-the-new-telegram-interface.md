From today, students can use Telegram to engage with course challenges on ChallengeHub.
This is in addition to the e-mail and LINE ChallengeBot interfaces already available.

As usual, students can submit their answers to ChallengeBot in order to receive immediate feedback, increasing the efficiency of their study and raising motivation, as well as enabling teacher monitoring and [optimised peer-instruction grouping in class]( /2020/04/10/announcing-study-teams/ ).

In addition to the accessible e-mail interface, the Telegram and LINE interfaces are well known instant messaging platforms in different areas of the world.
We are pleased to have more options available so students will be able to interact with ChallengeBot on the platform they are most comfortable with.
We hope this will help more students make a smooth transition to challenge-based active learning with ChallengeHub.
