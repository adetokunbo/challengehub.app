From today, students can use [Telegram](https://telegram.org) to engage with course challenges on ChallengeHub.
This means that as well as ChallengeBot being available via email and [LINE](https://line.me/en/), you can now access it via Telegram too.

As usual, students can submit their answers to ChallengeBot in order to receive immediate feedback, increasing the efficiency of their study and raising motivation, as well as enabling teacher monitoring and [optimised peer-instruction grouping in class]( /2020/04/10/announcing-study-teams/ ).

We are pleased to have more options available so students will be able to interact with ChallengeBot on the platform they are most comfortable with.
We hope this will help more students make a smooth transition to challenge-based active learning with ChallengeHub.
