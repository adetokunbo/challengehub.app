Starting today, ChallengeHub can automatically and optimally group students for peer instruction in class. Whether there are 10 students or 100, desks are forward-facing or islands: ChallengeHub maximises class value by ensuring students get the most out of discussion with their peers.

Why is this important? It realises scalable 1-to-1 teaching. More students get personalised help with the questions they have; something impossible in a traditional setting. Students are more motivated to attend class since they know that they will get help with their specific problem. And by helping others, students gain a far deeper understanding of the concepts involved.

Meanwhile, the teacher has the benefit of being free to engage in targeted interventions with specific students in class while there is the satisfaction of hearing the low background murmur of learning.

ChallengeHub is able to do this by utilising data about student progress through challenges to predict optimal study teams in a way that would be impossible for the teacher to do manually.

From setting your stint up to having the students seated
You can now choose for the stint for your class to use study teams.

Students are assigned locations, and students with a shared location form a team. That location could be a desk and row, a section of a lecture theatre, or any other form of location designation provided by the teacher. Locations are designated by row and desk.

## From the student perspective, the flow is as follows:

1. ChallengeBot automatically informs students of an upcoming stint with study teams and asks about intention to attend (no teacher interaction required).
1. Students reply with the intention to attend or be absent (non-replies are assumed to be absent). Details of how to do this are included in the `help` available to students.
1. Two hours before the stint, assigned desk designations are fixed and students can check their assigned locations.
1. Upon entering the classroom, students locate their desk and are seated with the other team member(s).

If students have not used ChallengeHub with study teams before, the first class or two will probably require some time for students to get used to finding their seat, but this soon becomes natural to students.

Some ideas for creating a coordinate system for you classroom include:

- Have students count from the first row and desk (column) in the classroom. The room plan can be projected at the front of the class. For example, row 1 is at the front of the classroom and desk 1 is on the left, closest to the door. Some teachers choose to print the plan and have it attached to the entrance of the classroom. Note that this only needs to be prepared once per classroom used.
- Print row and desk labels and have them attached to the appropriate positions prior to the class. For island desks without a grid, choose “1 row” and then label each desk by number.

ChallengeHub is continuing to innovate together with teachers to upgrade both the in-classroom and out-of-classroom experience.
