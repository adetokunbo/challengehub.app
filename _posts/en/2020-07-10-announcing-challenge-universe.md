Starting today, you can find other teachers' published challenges in Challenge Universe.
Such external Challenges may be added to your own challenge library and used in your courses.
You may also amend them to make your own version,
or copy them to start a challenge of your own resusing some elements.

We encourage you to take a look at some challenges â€”
please [request an invitation]( /contact/ ) if you do not have one. 

This can save a lot of time when handing a course to a fellow teacher,
but we also expect it to be especially useful for
newly registered teachers to get up and running,
gaining experience and confidence by looking at a number of readily available challenges
and basing some of their first classes using ChallengeHub on those.

The ChallengeHub experience is today more accessible and welcoming than ever.
We hope you will find the challenges useful,
as well as we are looking forward to Challenge Universe keeping growing.
