Starting today, it is possible to view other teachers' published challenges in the Challenge Universe.
Find a challenge you like?
You can easily import it into your library and be ready to use it in a course,
or amend the contents to customise it for your needs.

This is a big step in ChallengeHub's effort to fix the incredible inefficiencies in teaching.
How many other teachers around the world are teaching the same course as you?
Even for many specialist subjects, it's unlikely that your course is unique.
Despite this, too many teachers still start course preparation from scratch.

Challenge Universe starts to change this.

As a new teacher, 
you can gain confidence by looking at a number of readily available challenges
and basing your course on those challenges.
This gives you more time to focus on your teaching and less on content generation,
promoting high quality education
even in that ever-stressful first year of teaching a course.

As an experienced teacher, even one teaching a highly-specialist subject,
you can have an impact beyond the walls of your classroom by enabling other teachers, with attributation, to benefit from what you build.
And you might even find an interesting challenge to improve your existing course.

Furthermore,
when handing a course to a fellow teacher,
you can easily share the challenges from your course,
making handover that much easier.

The ChallengeHub experience is today more accessible and welcoming than ever.
We encourage you to take a look at the available challenges,
contribute your own challenges to the Challenge Universe,
and join us in our quest to make high-quality education more accessable than ever.
