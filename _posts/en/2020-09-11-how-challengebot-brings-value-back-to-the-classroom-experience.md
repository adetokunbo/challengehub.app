University experiments to regain relevance remain niche due to difficulty of implementation and legacy infrastructure.
How are universities going to adapt? By leveraging their social-learning advantage. This is where ChallengeHub comes in: we are creating the product that defines how universities around the world will adapt to this change in the future, and we will do this by addressing a current need in a future-proof way.

## The competition the classroom is facing

The classroom-based higher education model has been under threat for a while by the following:

- Video lectures and other online-focussed offerings
- Micro-credentials and other alternative qualifications offered by non-academic entities

However, we believe that much of the value in what the classroom has to offer is not supplied by these alternatives.

## What the competition lacks

What is the 1 thing you cannot get from MOOC sites like Coursera, from Khan academy or from your teacher putting lectures and quizzes online? Social learning.
If you get stuck, or need to ask a question, you’re on your own.
This should be the reason that classes exist.

Now, there are plenty of active learning / flipped classroom products and services out there, but they all require a significant amount of extra work by the teacher, and this is why despite all the advances in methodology and technology, most teachers are still lecturing.

## What ChallengeHub brings to the table

ChallengeHub raises university value by optimising social learning by means of an efficient way to make efficient peer and making teaching more efficient

The future-proofing comes by enhancing the university’s strongest asset: The value of coming to class.
The automatic optimised grouping of students in class motivates the students to attend and ensures they get help with their problems mostly without needing to ask the teacher directly.

We optimise social learning in class by using the data that we gather from student interaction to place them in small groups optimised for peer-instruction in the classroom, using a scalable method based on location that has been shown to work even in a classroom of 100 students. Students can teach and learn from each other in an optimised personalised efficient way, that they couldn’t achieve on their own or other means.

The benefits are clear for all parties. Social interaction is more enjoyable that talking at people, so it makes teaching more enjoyable. Students now have a reason to come to class and what the teacher says in class is more likely to be useful to them, so they enjoy it more too. And with the new value of coming to classes, university administrators are also happier.

## Conclusion

As we move towards online classes and micro-credentials, CH is the way that we bring value  
back to the classroom experience — and go way beyond what the lecture ever gave.
