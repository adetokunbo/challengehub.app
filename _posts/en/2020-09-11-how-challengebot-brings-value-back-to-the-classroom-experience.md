Social learning is a key part of university value.
But what is social learning?
Why is it valuable, and how does ChallengeHub enable teachers and their institutions to achieve social learning in their classrooms?

## The best way to learn something is to teach it

As every teacher surely knows, the best way to learn something is to teach it to others.
For example, in my differential equations class I found understanding increased more when students could help each other with problems.
This is because having student A explain something to student B means that student A identifies hidden gaps in their own understanding.
Student A often also has a better appreciation for the difficulties in learning the concept, compared to a teacher like myself who may have learned the concept many years ago.

Meanwhile student B can ask questions and have the explanation tailored exactly to their level, achieving personalised tutoring that is impossible to achieve otherwise.
Of course, I am always on hand to support students if extra help is required or a bigger-picture explanation is desired.

This experience is a key example of social learning, and is something that universities are particularly suited for.
In the case where both “teacher” and “student” are students, this is often referred to as “peer instruction”.
What ChallengeHub does is optimise this peer instruction and make it easy to implement on large scales.
This then benefits the students, teacher and university alike.

## Enhancing the value of universities as centres of social learning

ChallengeHub takes social learning to a new level by ensuring that the ability of students to help each other is not left to chance.

Imagine that, as a student, you know that by attending class (whether online or offline) you are guaranteed to get an effective, personalised explanation for the problem that you personally have, even if there are 100 other students present.
By making this possible, ChallengeHub makes class attendance more meaningful, makes the life of the teacher easier and raises value for the university as a centre of social learning.

How is this done?
Teachers can choose to have [grouping in class]( /2020/04/10/announcing-study-teams/ ), and ChallengeHub takes care of the rest.
Students are automatically grouped (typically in pairs or threes) and students are directed to their groups automatically when class starts.
ChallengeHub can ensure effective peer instruction because it keeps track of student interaction with ChallengeBot, including, for example, challenges answered correctly and wrongly, and uses a proprietary algorithm to group students for maximum pedagogical effect.

Beyond being beneficial for students, social learning reduces stress for the teacher, since most questions can be answered by other students in their groups, letting the teacher focus on what really counts.
Furthermore, social learning is more fun than studying alone.
Survey’s show that 80% of students not only find classes more effective and useful, but also more enjoyable; and this goes for teachers too!

Finally, in a world of growing alternatives to university education and increasing pressures due to the pandemic, the increased effectiveness and enjoyment raises the value of attending university in a scalable and cost effective manner. 

## Conclusion

ChallengeHub is built to bring value back to attending classes by enabling scalable and optimised social learning.
It makes classes more effective for students, easier for teachers, and raises the value of attending university in a way that has never been achieved on a large and cost-effective scale before.
At ChallengeHub we strongly believe that effective social learning should be the norm rather than the exception, and we look forward to continuing to work with higher education institutions to make this a reality.
