Social learning is a key part of university value.
In this post, I will explain what social learning is, and how ChallengeHub enables teachers and their institutions to realise valuable social learning in their classrooms.

## The best way to learn something is to teach it

As every teacher has experienced, the best way to learn something is to teach it to others.
This is the same whether you are a professional teacher or a student teaching another student.
The act of organising the information and breaking it down for others forces the teacher to identify areas where they themselves lack understanding.

Furthermore, in a 1-to-1 teaching situation, the student on the receiving end of the explanation can ask questions and get an explanation exactly tailored to their current level of understanding; something impossible through other more automated methods.

This is a key example of social learning, and is something that universities are particularly suited for.
In the case where both “teacher” and “student” are students, this is often referred to as “peer instruction”.
What ChallengeHub does is optimise this peer instruction and make it easy to implement on large scales.
This then benefits the students, teacher and university alike.

## The value of universities as centres of social learning

Imagine that, as a student, you know that by attending class (whether online or offline) you will get a personalised explanation for the problem that you specifically have, even if there are 100 other students present.
By making this possible, ChallengeHub makes class attendance more meaningful, makes the life of the teacher easier and raises value for the university as a centre of social learning.

How is this done?
Teachers can choose to have [grouping in class]( /2020/04/10/announcing-study-teams/ ), and ChallengeHub takes care of the rest.
Students are automatically grouped (typically in pairs or threes) and students are directed to their groups automatically when class starts.
ChallengeHub can ensure effective peer instruction because it keeps track of student interaction with ChallengeBot, including, for example, challenges answered correctly and wrongly, and uses a proprietary algorithm to group students for maximum pedagogical effect.

Beyond being beneficial for students, social learning reduces stress for the teacher, since most questions can be answered by other students in their groups, letting the teacher focus on what really counts.
Furthermore, social learning is more fun than studying alone.
Survey’s show that 80% of students not only find classes more effective and useful, but also more enjoyable; and this goes for teachers too!

Finally, in a world of growing alternatives to university education and increasing pressures due to the pandemic, the increased effectiveness and enjoyment raises the value of attending university in a scalable and cost effective manner. 

## Conclusion

ChallengeHub is built to bring value back to attending classes by enabling scalable and optimised social learning.
It makes classes more effective for students, easier for teachers, and raises the value of attending university in a way that has never been achieved on a large and cost-effective scale before.
At ChallengeHub we strongly believe that effective social learning should be the norm rather than the exception, and we look forward to continuing to work with higher education institutions to make this a reality.
