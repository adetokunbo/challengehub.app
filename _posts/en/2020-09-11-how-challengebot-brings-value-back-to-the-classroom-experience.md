A significant part of the value Universities are providing to students and society as a whole is a social learning environment.

ChallengeHub might be a service you use on the internet, but it is not limited to online classes and it is not focussed on solo studying. ChallengeHub is designed to enhance and play into social learning, from the ground.

## The social learning environment

University students are old and educated enough to learn by themselves if provided the needed resources but, while some will do well at that and somem will struggle, all students benefit from interacting with their teachers and other students.

## What ChallengeHub brings to the table

ChallengeHub raises university value by optimising social learning by means of an efficient way to make efficient peer and making teaching more efficient

The future-proofing comes by enhancing the university’s strongest asset: The value of coming to class.
The automatic optimised grouping of students in class motivates the students to attend and ensures they get help with their problems mostly without needing to ask the teacher directly.

We optimise social learning in class by using the data that we gather from student interaction to place them in small groups optimised for peer-instruction in the classroom, using a scalable method based on location that has been shown to work even in a classroom of 100 students. Students can teach and learn from each other in an optimised personalised efficient way, that they couldn’t achieve on their own or other means.

The benefits are clear for all parties. Social interaction is more enjoyable that talking at people, so it makes teaching more enjoyable. Students now have a reason to come to class and what the teacher says in class is more likely to be useful to them, so they enjoy it more too. And with the new value of coming to classes, university administrators are also happier.

## Conclusion

ChallengeHub is the product that defines how universities around the world will adapt to the new times, and we do this by addressing a current need in a future-proof way.
