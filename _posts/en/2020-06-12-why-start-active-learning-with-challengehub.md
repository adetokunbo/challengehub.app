Active learning typically involves a two-way interactive experience for students and the teacher,
and while this is known to be more effective and motivating for the students,
the added complexity makes it stressful for the teacher.
Our vision at ChallengeHub is to make it easier to teach better,
achieving the benefit of active learning while simultaneously removing complexity:
truly active learning for _everyone_.

### Traditional active learning introduces uncertainty

Stress points in traditional active learning methodologies include
the loss of control and uncertainty of what is going to happen after the class starts:

- What will I need to explain in depth about?
- How much material do I need to prepare for the class?
- Did students pre-read the assigned materials?
- Did students find the pre-class material too easy or too hard?
- Will the activities planned for the class be appropriate for their level of understanding?
- If some students finish earlier than others, what should I ask them to do?

Such uncertainty induces a ‘plan for all scenarios’ response,
raising teacher stress levels and making it harder to teach well.

### How ChallengeHub solves the uncertainty issue

ChallengeHub addresses such stress through three primary methods:

1. Making it clear to the teacher ahead of class what preparation is and is not required
1. Promoting high-quality interaction between students in class
1. Developing a free flowing yet structured classroom schedule

Since ChallengeBot is facilitating students submitting answers to challenges
and indicating difficulty,
the teacher has an advance view through the dashboard about any difficulties
and can anticipate what questions will come up.
Students can also leave feedback about individual challenges,
further aiding preparation.
This not only reduces stress but enables more efficient class preparation too.

In the classroom, ChallengeBot can optimally group students into teams
to ensure that most questions can be handled through peer-instruction,
and the required interaction with the teacher is kept to manageable levels
even with large class sizes.

Even in traditional lectures timing can be an issue,
but ChallengeHub enables such uncertainty to become a thing of the past.
A typical approach is to follow any short class-wide explanation with team discussion
until the end of class,
removing the need for an exact timetable of activities.
Students will of course progress at different paces through challenges,
but this difference can be made level through completion of remaining challenges as homework.

Finally, the rate of challenge completion gives a clear indication
as to the appropriate amount of material for each class or week of study,
making it easier to get a sense if the course is moving too fast or too slow.

### Conclusion

Our vision at ChallengeHub is to bring the benefits of active learning
out from small niche implementations to the mainstream,
and to achieve that we know that making class easier for the teacher is key.

With advance-knowledge of student difficulties and optimised in-class peer instruction,
ChallengeHub offers a platform for achieving such a vision,
reducing the complexity of teaching while simultaneously increasing
the usefulness of the class for students.

We continue to welcome teachers to work with us to continue
innovating a better education solution that addresses
the needs of both students and teachers alike.
