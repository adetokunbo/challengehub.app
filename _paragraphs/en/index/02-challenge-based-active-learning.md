Learning focuses around a series of challenges, taking students from beginner to expert.

Small but frequent wins motivate students while they obtain personalised explanations about difficult concepts from their peers in class.

With real-time monitoring the teacher can focus class preparation on what really counts, delivering targeted explanations about things that really matter to the students.
