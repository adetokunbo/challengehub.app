Learning focuses around a series of challenges, taking students from beginner to expert.

Small but frequent wins motivate students, and with real-time monitoring the teacher saves time by focussing class preparation on what really counts.

ChallengeHub intelligently manages the active learning environment, so the teacher can focus on the subject in hand.

Challenge-based active learning can be adopted to suit a wide variety of course styles. As a teacher, you decide what works best for you and your students.
