ChallengeHub intelligently manages the active learning environment, freeing the teacher to focus on the subject in hand.

This is achieved with ChallengeBot, your active learning teaching assistant. ChallengeBot provides students with instant feedback, monitors progress and organises the classroom environment.

Students interact with ChallengeBot through email or an instant messaging platform they are probably already familiar with. No passwords to forget or unfamiliar apps to download.

You shouldn't need to be an expert in active learning to use active learning.
