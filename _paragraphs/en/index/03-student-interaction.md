ChallengeBot is your active learning TA, providing students with instant feedback, monitoring progress and managing the in-class active-learning environment.

Students interact with ChallengeBot through email or an instant messaging platform they're probably already familiar with. No passwords to forget or unfamiliar apps to download.

ChallengeHub intelligently manages the active learning environment, freeing the teacher to focus on the subject in hand.

You shouldn't need to be an expert in active learning to use active learning.
