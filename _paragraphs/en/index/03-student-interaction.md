Your students don't need to have a password or even log into our system. They don't need to go to our website or download a specific app either. Students can just chat to ChallengeBot through a well-known instant messaging platform of their choice, including email.

ChallengeBot is available 24/7 and will hand any challenges out to them, remember their progress, and tell them if they got the challenges right or not. This enables them to work on the subject at any time they have available, while having instant feedback.

They are dealing with ChallengeBot, not the teacher himself or herself, so that's also one less friction point.
