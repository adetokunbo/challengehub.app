heading: You can do better than lectures

Traditional lectures are inefficient, decreasing both student and teacher motivation.

Traditional active learning aims to address this, but lectures often remain at the centre of the student experience.

ChallengeHub is different. Effective student discussion becomes central. Teacher explanations are targeted and useful.

Our dream is to revolutionise education; to create a world where all students *want* to come to class; where education is efficient, effective and enjoyable for both students and teachers.
