ChallengeHub does not store passwords, and instead uses GitHub for teacher authentication. For this reason, teachers will need to register an account with GitHub. This page walks you through the process to do this.

If at any time you have any difficulties or questions, do not hesitate to contact us at [info@challengehub.app](mailto:info@challengehub.app). We will be happy to help.

GitHub is owned by Microsoft and has over 37 million users. It is safe, secure and free from spam.

Note that students do *not* need to register with GitHub. Only teachers need to register through GitHub to to allow the secure management of courses and view the progress of the students.

To begin registration, first go to https://github.com and sign up by entering a username, email address and password before clicking *Sign up for GitHub*.
