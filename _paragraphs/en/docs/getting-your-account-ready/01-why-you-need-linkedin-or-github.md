ChallengeHub does not store passwords, and instead uses LinkedIn or GitHub for teacher authentication. For this reason we need you to have an account with either of them, and we need to know your LinkedIn ID or GitHub ID. If you have any of those, feel free to skip to the next section.

If at any time you have any difficulties or questions, do not hesitate to contact us at [info@challengehub.app](mailto:info@challengehub.app). We will be happy to help.

Both LinkedIn and GitHub are owned by Microsoft. LinkedIn has over 660 million users, and GitHub has over 40 million users. They are safe, secure, and free from spam.

Note that students do *not* need to register with LinkedIn or GitHub. Only teachers need to do so to allow secure management of their courses and secure access to student progress.

If you do not yet have an account with either site, we would recommend LinkedIn for most teachers, because of its support for many languages and more general utility.

- [Sign up for LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com)
- [Sign up for GitHub](https://github.com)
