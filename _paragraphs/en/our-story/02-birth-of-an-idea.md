After some research it was clear that active learning was better for students, but it wasn't until moving to Kyushu University in 2016 that James had the opportunity to experiment with such methods.

Flipped-classroom methodology seemed perfect: students pre-study before coming to class then work together discussing concepts in class. But he quickly found out—most students don't pre-study. The experiment failed.

Then James realised he didn't want students to read—he wanted them to learn. And learning meant studying concepts deeply enough to answer questions.
Challenge-based active learning was born.
