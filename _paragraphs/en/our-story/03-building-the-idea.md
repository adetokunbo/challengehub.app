Initially, challenges were published in a PDF and James would gather feedback, manually pairing students who could help each other in class. It was working, however tracking progress was difficult and it was only feasible for small class sizes. A new, more scalable method was required.

This led to a key question: Despite the absence of funding and programming expertise, how could a self-sustaining revolution in education modernisation be realised—not only in James's classroom but across the world?

The answer: launch a start-up to create technology that made it easier to teach better. Have it funded by teachers who found it useful—who believed in the same dream of high-quality modern education—while adhering to an open education philosophy.

ChallengeHub was born.
