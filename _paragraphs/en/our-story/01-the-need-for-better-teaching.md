Students sleeping during class or playing mobile games. Does that sound familiar? This was the experience of Dr James Cannon at the University of Tokyo when he started teaching in 2015.

Initially he taught the same way he'd been taught: talking as he wrote on the blackboard or going through slides on a projector. But seeing many students get bored made him realiseâ€”there must be a better way.

There were other problems too. When students got stuck on homework, no-one was around to help. And as a teacher, James felt most of what he was saying could just as easily be looked up by the students themselves. The lecture seemed to be a very inefficient use of both student and teacher time.
