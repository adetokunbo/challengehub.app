Below are some example ChallengeBot commands that can be used in both interface variants.

  - A command like "name Carrie Fisher" can be used to change the student's registered name, to help the teacher identify the student
  - "c1 easy 42" will attempt to solve the course's first challenge (c1), giving 42 as an answer and "easy" as the student's perceived difficulty for the challenge

Both interface variants can be used in the students' language of choice.
ChallengeBot is always ready to help them be sure if they got their homework right!
