Email provides most flexibility and accessibility, while the instant messaging interface provides a more comfortable and familiar workflow for most students.

By typing intuitive commands in the mail subject or in a chat with ChallengeBot, students can easily manage their own progress through the course.

And with ChallengeBot capable of multiple languages from Europe and Asia, support for modern classroom diversity is built in.
