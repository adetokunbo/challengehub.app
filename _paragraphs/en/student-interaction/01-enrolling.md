Once your course is ready with some challenges, you can have your students enroll.
At this point, they can choose between using email or an off-the-shelf instant messaging service.

Whichever way they choose, they never need to sign up with us or enter any password.
We take our users' privacy very seriosly, and only collect as much data as we need.
Students only need to send mail to your course's registration address, or befriend ChallengeBot.
