Students use email or an instant messaging interface like LINE to enroll. The teacher just shares the course email address and code, and leaves the rest to ChallengeBot.

If students have not used ChallengeHub before, ChallengeBot helps them to get started. A handy QR code is also provided for the teacher to share, enabling messaging users to friend ChallengeBot quickly.
