#### Effective education management
- __Easy active learning implementation__: We believe that the teacher should be free to teach and not need to worry about the technical details of enhanced education.
- __Reusable challenges__: We believe teaching should be efficient, with teaching material reusable and improvable over time.
- __Effective classroom peer instruction__: We believe that student development goes beyond problem solving, and that discussion and teaching ability are important qualities for life after graduation.
- __Progress monitoring__: We believe that teacher intervention should be useful and targeted.

#### Open education
- __Ownership of your challenges__: We believe that teachers should own what they create.
- __Challenges available forever__: We believe in open education, where teachers always have free access to what they create.

#### Accessible to all students
- __Interaction using familiar apps__: We believe that technology should enhance and not hinder access to education.
- __Free for students__: We believe that education should be free at the point of use.
- __Instant marking__: We believe that learning confirmation should be real-time, and therefore motivating and efficient.

## Coming soon

- __Challenge sharing__: We believe in open education and teacher efficiency; that teachers should be able to share what they create and collaborate on improvements.

## Be the change you want to see

Teaching is still mostly closed, inefficient and demotivating for students.

We stand for those who believe we can do better.
