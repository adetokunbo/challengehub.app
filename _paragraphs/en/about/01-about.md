### Effective education management

- __Easy active learning implementation__  
We believe that the teacher should be free to teach and not need to worry about the technical details of enhanced education.
- __Reusable challenges__  
We believe teaching should be efficient, with teaching material reusable and improvable over time.
- __Effective classroom peer instruction__  
We believe that student development goes beyond problem solving, and that discussion and teaching ability are important qualities for life after graduation.
- __Progress monitoring__  
We believe that teacher intervention should be useful and targeted.

### Open education

- __Open challenges__  
We believe that teachers should own what they create and with ChallengeHub you always have free access to what you create, forever.
- __Challenge sharing__  
We believe in open education and teacher efficiency; that teachers should be able to share what they create and collaborate on improvements.

### Access to education for everyone

- __Interaction using familiar apps__  
We believe that technology should enhance and not hinder access to education.
- __Free for students__  
We believe that education should be free at the point of use.
- __Instant marking__  
We believe that learning confirmation should be real-time, and subsequently motivating and efficient.

## Be the change you want to see

Teaching is still mostly closed, inefficient and demotivating for students.

We stand for those who believe we can do better.
