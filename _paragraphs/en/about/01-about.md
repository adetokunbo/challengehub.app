### Effective class time

- __Peer instruction__  
We believe that discussion, asking questions and explaining ideas are important qualities for life after graduation.
- __Easy active learning__  
We believe that the teacher should be free to focus on their subject of expertise.

### Open education

- __Efficient course development__  
We believe teaching material should be sharable, freely reusable and improvable over time.
- __Content ownership__  
We believe that teachers should own what they create, and always have free access to it.

### Access to education for everyone

- __Free education__  
We believe that education should be free at the point of use.
- __Positive technology__  
We believe that technology should enhance and not hinder access to education.

## Be the change you want to see

Teaching is still mostly closed, inefficient and demotivating.
We stand for those who believe we can do better.
