### At ChallengeHub we stand for effective class time

- __Easy active learning__

We believe that discussion, asking questions and explaining ideas are better ways to learn and important skills for life after graduation

### At ChallengeHub we stand for open education

- __Efficient course development__  
We believe teaching material should be sharable, freely reusable and improvable over time
- __Content ownership__  
We believe that teachers should own what they create, and always have free access to it

### At ChallengeHub we stand for access to education for everyone

- __Free education__  
We believe that education should be free at the point of use

We believe that technology should enhance and not hinder access to education

## Be the change you want to see

Teaching is still mostly closed, inefficient and demotivating.

We stand for those who believe we can do better.
