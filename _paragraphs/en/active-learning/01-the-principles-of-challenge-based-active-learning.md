Learning focusses around a series of challenges, with each challenge addressing a concept.

Each challenge builds upon understanding gained from previous challenges.

Students spend more time on challenges they find difficult and less time on those they find easy.

Class time consists of discussion between students, and optionally a short explanation or demonstration by the teacher.
