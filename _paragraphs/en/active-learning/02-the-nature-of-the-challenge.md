Unlike traditional flipped-classroom models, study focusses on the challenge, not the reading. This gives students clear motivation to complete assigned tasks.

With relevant resources included by the teacher, students learn valuable self-study habits in a structured environment.

In contrast to traditional homework, the student can immediately check their answer, keeping them in the flow when it's wrong and providing a motivational win when it's right.
