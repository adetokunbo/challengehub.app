Challenges are grouped by *stint*, and stints are only visible to students after they are released.

Enter the release time and date of the stint and give it a descriptive name. Then click *Add stint*.

Note: You can only select a release date between the start and end of the course. If you need to adjust the course date range, you can do this on the *Info* tab.
