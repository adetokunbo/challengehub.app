        <h2>Teaching well is hard. But it doesnâ€™t have to be</h2>
        <p>Active-learning is known to improve student motivation and understanding, but until now the cost of implementation for the teacher has meant it remains a niche experiment.</p>
        <p>Our mission is to revolutionise teaching by making it easier to implement active-learning than to lecture.</p>

        <h2>CBAL: Challenge-Based Active Learning</h2>
        <p>Learning focuses around a series of challenges, taking students from beginner to expert.</p>
        <p>Small but frequent wins motivate students, and with real-time monitoring the teacher saves time by focussing class preparation on what really counts.</p>
        <p>Challenge-hub intelligently manages the active learning environment, so the teacher can focus on the subject in hand.</p>
        <p>Implement your entire course around CBAL or integrate it into your existing methodology. You decide what works best for you and your students.</p>
