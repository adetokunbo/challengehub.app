				<h2>Teaching <em>well</em> is hard. But it doesn’t have to be</h2>
				<p>Active-learning is known to improve student motivation and understanding, but until now the cost of implementation for the teacher has meant it remains a niche experiment.</p>
				<p>Our mission is to revolutionise education by making it easier to implement active-learning than to lecture.</p>

				<h2>CBAL: Challenge-Based Active Learning</h2>
				<p>Teaching focuses around a series of challenges set by the teacher that students work through, taking them from beginner to expert.</p>
				<p>Small but frequent wins motivate students, and with real-time monitoring the teacher saves time by focussing class preparation on what really counts.</p>
				<p>Challenge-hub intelligently manages the active learning environment, so you can focus on the subject in hand.</p>
				<p>Implement your entire course around CBAL or integrate it into your existing methodology. You decide what works best for you and your students.</p>

				<h2>What is active learning?</h2>
				<p>Active Learning first came to prominence in 1XXX, … There are many ways to make your class active.</p>
				<p><strong>How Challenge-Based Active Learning works</strong></p>
				<p>Challenge-Based Active Learning (CBAL) is primarily focussed around a series of challenges, with each challenge addressing a certain concept.</p>
				<p>The challenges are arranged so that each challenge builds upon knowledge gained in previous challenges.</p>
				<p>The student works through the challenges one-by-one, spending more time on challenges they find more difficult and less time on those that are easier.</p>
				<p>Class time consists of discussion between students, and optionally a short lecture or demonstration by the teacher.</p>

					<h2>CBAL workflow</h2>
					<ul class="top-ul">
						<li>Read the next challenge</li>
						<ul>
							<li>The emphasis of CBAL is on the challenges, not the reading material. Challenges should be crafted so that the necessary learning must take place in order to complete the challenge.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Refer to suggested resources</li>
						<ul>
							<li>The teacher usually suggests some resources from which the students can derive the answer.</li>
							<li>The resources may be a chapter in a textbook or a publically available online video.</li>
							<li>The teacher does not need to create the content of the resource; simply view it and ensure correctness and accuracy.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Calculate answer</li>
						<li>Instant Feedback</li>
						<li>Discuss in class</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>How to optimise your CBAL course</h2>
					<p>Step-size between challenges is important - too small and the students will find the course too easy, less interesting and too time-consuming. Too large, and too many students will get stuck. That optimum step-size depends on the ability of the students and the nature of the course, and can gradually be honed over repetitions of the course.</p>

					<h2>How Challenge-Based Active Learning works for students</h2>
					<h3>Deeper understanding than lectures</h3>
					<p>Lecturing is a poor method of information transfer. Students can only concentrate for X minutes at a time, and only remember X% of a typical lecture. CBAL optimises the class-time so it is useful to every student.</p>
					<p>Personalised education can be realised through peer-instruction in class. The weaker student gets a tailor-made explanation while the stronger student deepens understanding through explaining their reasoning.</p>
					<p>Mastery-based progression ensures students gain a solid foundation of knowledge and remain engaged in the course from beginning to end.</p>
					<h3>Promotes a positive learning environment</h3>
					<p>Homework encourages weaker students to copy from their friends because failure is penalised. In CBAL, students are encouraged to discuss difficulties and approaches with each other, promoting an infectiously positive learning environment.</p>
					<p>Each challenge is a small step on the way to mastery. Each successful challenge completion is rewarding for students, helping to make studying fun and engaging.</p>
					<p>CBAL encourages students to take responsibility for their learning, setting them up for a life of learning after graduation.</p>
					<h3>Achieves greater learning efficiency</h3>
					<p>In traditional homework patterns, feedback is delayed and students rarely revise wrong answers. With enhanced answer checking features, students can get instant feedback about correctness, keeping them engaged, giving them ownership of their learning and significantly increasing learning efficiency.</p>
					<p>Working on challenges in class and discussing with their peers, class-time is optimised to rapidly progress their understanding.</p>
					<p>Using directed study materials, the student spends more time on things that are hard for them, and less time on things that are easy.</p>
					<h3>Builds discussion skills and the ability to ask questions</h3>
					<p>Each class is centred around time for discussion between students, so students get ample experience of asking questions to each other and justifying their approaches to a challenge.</p>
					<p>With a positive learning environment, students are empowered to discuss difficulties and increase their level of achievement.</p>
