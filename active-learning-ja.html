        <h2>The principles of challenge-based active learning</h2>
        <p>Learning focusses around a series of challenges, with each challenge addressing a concept.</p>
        <p>Each challenge builds upon understanding gained from previous challenges.</p>
        <p>Students spend more time on challenges they find difficult and less time on those they find easy.</p>
        <p>Class time consists of discussion between students, and optionally a short lecture or demonstration by the teacher.</p>

        <h2>The nature of the challenge</h2>
        <p>Unlike traditional flipped-classroom models, study focusses on the challenge, not the reading. This gives students clear motivation to complete assigned tasks.</p>
        <p>With relevant resources included by the teacher, students learn valuable self-study habits in a structured environment.</p>
        <p>In contrast to traditional homework, the student can immediately check their answer, keeping them in the flow when it's wrong and providing a motivational win when it's right.</p>

        <h2>The nature of the class</h2>
        <p>The teacher walks into the classroom knowing the progress of the class and likely questions, resulting in efficient class-preparation and student learning.</p>
        <p>Challenge-Hub automatically pairs students based on their performance, enabling personalised instruction as students ask each other questions, discuss difficult concepts and learn how to explain ideas.</p>
        <p>Although much of the class is devoted to valuable pair-discussion, the teacher can still choose to lecture to introduce a topic, motivate students or otherwise address a class-wide issue.</p>
