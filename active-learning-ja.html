        <h2>The principle of Challenge-Based Active Learning</h2>
        <p>Challenge-Based Active Learning (CBAL) focusses around a series of challenges, with each challenge addressing a concept.</p>
        <p>Each challenge builds upon understanding gained from previous challenges.</p>
        <p>Students spend more time on challenges they find difficult and less time on those they find easy.</p>
        <p>Class time consists of discussion between students, and optionally a short lecture or demonstration by the teacher.</p>

        <h2>The nature of the challenge</h2>
        <p>Students will often not read background material unless the motivation is clear. Unlike traditional flipped-classroom models, CBAL focusses on the challenges, not the reference material.</p>
        <p>The teacher can suggest reference resources, and the student may choose to use them or use other resources, even sharing them with the teacher or class if desired.</p>
        <p>In contrast to traditional homework, with enhanced answer-checking the student can immediately check their answer, keeping them in the flow when it's wrong and providing a motivational win when it's right.</p>

        <h2>The nature of the class</h2>
        <p>Discussion between students in class is an integral part of CBAL. Challenge-hub automatically pairs students based on their performance, enabling peer-instruction as students discuss difficult concepts and ideas with each other.</p>
        <p>The teacher walks into the classroom knowing the progress of the class and what questions are likely to come up, making for efficient class-preparation and student learning.</p>
        <p>The teacher can still lecture to introduce a topic, motivate students or otherwise address a class-wide issue.</p>

        <h3>In-class discussion period</h3>
        <p>Lecturing except the last part of the class is some sort of challenge-answering... an easy dip-the-toe-in-the-water approach</p>

        <h2>CBAL makes teaching and learning <i>efficient</i></h2>

        <h3>Deeper understanding than lectures</h3>
        <p>Lecturing is a poor method of information transfer. CBAL optimises the class-time so it is useful to every student.</p>
        <p>Personalised education can be realised through peer-instruction in class. The weaker student gets a tailor-made explanation while the stronger student deepens understanding through explaining their reasoning.</p>
        <p>Mastery-based progression ensures students gain a solid foundation of knowledge and remain engaged in the course from beginning to end.</p>
        <h3>Promotes a positive learning environment</h3>
        <p>Homework encourages weaker students to copy from their friends because failure is penalised. In CBAL, students are encouraged to discuss difficulties and approaches with each other, promoting an infectiously positive learning environment.</p>
        <p>Each challenge is a small step on the way to mastery. Each successful challenge completion is rewarding for students, helping to make studying fun and engaging.</p>
        <p>CBAL encourages students to take responsibility for their learning, setting them up for a life of learning after graduation.</p>
        <h3>Achieves greater learning efficiency</h3>
        <p>In traditional homework patterns, feedback is delayed and students rarely revise wrong answers. With enhanced answer checking features, students can get instant feedback about correctness, keeping them engaged, giving them ownership of their learning and significantly increasing learning efficiency.</p>
        <p>Working on challenges in class and discussing with their peers, class-time is optimised to rapidly progress their understanding.</p>
        <p>Using directed study materials, the student spends more time on things that are hard for them, and less time on things that are easy.</p>
        <h3>Builds discussion skills and the ability to ask questions</h3>
        <p>Each class is centred around time for discussion between students, so students get ample experience of asking questions to each other and justifying their approaches to a challenge.</p>
        <p>With a positive learning environment, students are empowered to discuss difficulties and increase their level of achievement.</p>
